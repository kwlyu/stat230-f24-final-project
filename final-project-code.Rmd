## Data Wrangling

```{r Reading and Cleaning Data}
happiness_raw <- read_csv("GSS_commute_happiness.csv")

happiness_cleaned <- happiness_raw %>%
  select(year, happy, commute, realrinc, educ, race, gender1) %>% 
  filter(commute != ".i:  Inapplicable",
         realrinc > 0,
         happy != ".n:  No answer") %>% 
  mutate(
    educ = case_when(
      str_detect(educ, "grade") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(educ, "\\d+")),
      str_detect(educ, "college") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(educ, "\\d+")) + 12,
      str_detect(educ, "No formal schooling") ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ NA
    ),
    commute = case_when(
      str_detect(commute, "\\d+") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(commute, "\\d+")),
      TRUE ~ NA
    ),
    race = if_else(race == "White", "White", "Non White"),
    gender = if_else(gender1 == "MALE", "Male", "Female")
  ) %>% 
  select(-gender1)

happiness_recode <- happiness_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(happy = if_else(happy == "Not too happy", 0, 1))
```

## EDA

```{r}
ggpairs(happiness_cleaned)

# Density plot for happiness by commute time
ggplot(happiness_cleaned, aes(x = happy, y = commute, fill = happy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Commute Time Distribution by Happiness Level", 
       x = "Commute Time (minutes)", 
       fill = "Happiness Level")

  labs(title = "Proportion of Happiness Levels by Education Level", 
       x = "Education Level", 
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Happiness Level") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Faceted bar plot for happiness levels by race and gender
ggplot(happiness_cleaned, aes(x = gender, fill = happy)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~ race) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Happiness by Race and Gender", 
       x = "Gender", 
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Happiness Level")
```

```{r}
# Boxplot for happiness by commute time

  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Commute Time Distribution by Happiness Level",  
       x = "Commute Time (minutes)", 
       fill = "Happiness Level")

# Boxplot of income by happiness level

# Arrange all plots in a 2x2 grid
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol = 2)
```


## Logistic Regression

```{r}
happiness_glm <- glm(happy ~ commute + realrinc + educ + race + gender, 
                     data = happiness_recode, family = binomial)

summary(happiness_glm)
```
